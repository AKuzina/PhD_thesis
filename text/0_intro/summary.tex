This thesis focuses on improving deep latent variable generative models.
We provide a comprehensive background on deep generative modeling, covering different model types, neural network parametrization, and learning algorithms in the introduction. 
Overall, this thesis contributes to advancing the field of deep latent variable generative models by enhancing both their density estimation capabilities and the quality of their learned representations.
The thesis is structured into two parts. 
Part 1 addresses research questions related to enhancing density estimation performance of the models by exploring better probabilistic modeling approaches.
Part 2 explores properties of the learned latent representations, such as adversarial robustness and equivariance, which can benefit downstream applications.
